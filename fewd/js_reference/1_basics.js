/*
	1. DATA TYPES
	There are several types of data you can use in your Javascript code.
	Numbers and strings are simplest and most common. To create a number,
	just type the number. A string is anything that appears between quotes.
*/

100 // this is a number
0 // this too
-1 // negative is fine

"Hello World" // this is a string
"100" // this is also a string!
"I like pie. 1234, <html> is fun." // you can put pretty much anything in a string


/*
	2. OPERATORS
	Operators act on data and create some result. There are lots of operators.
	The simplest ones are for familiar mathematical operations.
*/

1+1 // addition
1-1 // subtraction
10*100 // multiplication
50/10 // division
10%3 // modulous (remainder)
(1+1)*(10/5) // use parenthesis to specify order



/*
	3. EXPRESSIONS
	These expressions do something, and return a value.
*/

1+1 // returns 2
2*2 // returns 4
"Hello" // returns "Hello"
"Hello" + 2 // returns "Hello2"




/*
	4. VARIABLES
	Variables hold on to a value. Either the exact
	value you give it, or a return value from an expression.

	Create variables using the var keyword. Store or update a
	variable's value using the = operator.

	Remember, the variable name is up to you, it can be anything you want.
*/

var numTeams = 4
var secondsInDay = 24 * 60 * 60
var someName = "Max" + " " + "Sirena"



/*
	TIPS!
	remember that strings are considered text. Don't write code
	inside of a string, it won't do anything!
*/

"1 + 1" // probably not what you meant to do
"var test = 'foo'" // same here
